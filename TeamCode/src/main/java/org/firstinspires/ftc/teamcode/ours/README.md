# FTC MHS Codebase


**IMPORTANT**: everything prior to Decode (Into the Deep, Center Stage, Power Play) uses RoadRunner <= 0.5, and Decode uses Roadrunner == 1.0. Breaking changes in RoadRunner were made between 0.5 and 1.0, and RoadRunner 1.0 is not backwards compatible. This also means that build processes for later seasons using RoadRunner 1.0 will likely not be compatible with earlier seasons using RoadRunner 0.5.
