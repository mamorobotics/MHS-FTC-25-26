# Legacy README

This folder contains legacy code from previous years (from freight frenzy to into the deep). The code in this folder is excluded from the gradle build, to prevent errors, as we migrated to RoadRunner 1.0, which is incompatible with legacy code.

Notably, powerplay is missing. All of this code, and previous projects can be found on the mamorobotics github organization / account.
